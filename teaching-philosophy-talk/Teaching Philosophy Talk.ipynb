After that, I got a MSC and PhD here where I focused on human control of vehicles. During graduate school I was fortunate to spend a year in the Netherlands at TU Delft under a Fulbright grant. I also co-founded and co-ran an educational non-profit here in Davis during graduate school. The city of Davis recognized my efforts there with an award in 2013.

There are many researchers, including those here in the education school, that think study teaching methods in great detail. Just like our scientific research guides our engineering decisions, so should the education research guide our teaching decisions. For example, the book I show on the right should be read by every college instructor. It excellently provides seven principles for being a more effective teacher that are based on strong research evidence. I use these distillations of research knowledge for teachers to define my practical methods."

I break up these 15 minute sections with student activities, which can be a simple a multiple choice question or a longer group activity. I also make sure to use and share rubrics for grading. Students fill out self evaluations on their exam performance to help them think critically about why their performance was the way it was and how to improve. For labs, in particular, I typically do \"hands off teaching\" and never do the student's action for them. This was a important for teaching hands-on skills at the Davis Bike Collective."

    "Besides my main points I want to cover couple more topics that are relevant. First, these are the courses in this department's undergraduate curriculum that I am ready to teach. I'm mostly \"dry\" mechanical engineer. My undergraduate, professional, and some graduate work were focused on mechanical design related topics. I then developed strong dynamics and controls skills here, at TU Delft, and my post doctoral work so I can cover these courses. Finally, I've have gone off the deep in software engineering, open source software development, and scientific computation. I have a lot of ideas of how to give undergraduate students the fundamental skills need to be able to do things like app development, data analyses, and embedded control for their engineering projects. In fact I'd like to see computation increased in all typical mechanical engineering courses, as the world of data is already upon us.\n",

    "The advertisement for the position also indicates that a strong mechanical design background is needed. I want to mention several of my design experiences. I've designed full scale wind tunnel balances for NASA Langley, worked some in compressor design and manufacturing, designed several other experimental equipment. During my undergraduate years I participated in three different student design teams working on race cars, off road vehicles, and speed championship bicycles. I've done some design work for a Maglev train and finally I've worked with multiple groups in appropriate technology. In particular designing wheelchairs and human powered ambulances in Zambia and various other human powered machines in Guatemala."
